# Fit-Import

Import CVS files from [Withings][1] and [Kettler][2] into [Google Fit][3].

## Withings

While Withings has now Google Fit support this was not always the case. This app allows you to import older data recoded
before Withings started to store in Google Fit.

The Withings export format contains a timestamp, weight, fat and an comment.

	"Date","Gewicht (kg)","Fettmasse (kg)","Fettfreier Anteil (kg)","Kommentare"
	"2014-02-13 6:04 Uhr","94.34","26.81","68.43",""
	"2014-02-12 6:09 Uhr","94.89","27.43","67.36",""

## Kettler

The Kettler export format contains start time, end time, and trainings data as integers.
